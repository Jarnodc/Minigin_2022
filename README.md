# Minigin_2022
For Some reason is my data folder in my build not completed. So I added it here. This will work. It is just weird that this issue happened. My apologies.

I just noticed that my previous repos was not published because somewhere in a commit there was a .vs folder and therefore my files were over 100mb. I noticed it too late and therefore could not redo it. In this image I show my history of these github repos. But that is the reason why it has few publishes. This is now my 4th repos from Minigin, I had other bugs and crashes in the past. Like file name that changed, don't like github.
